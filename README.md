# Water Shortage Project

This project consists of a React frontend and Node.js backend application.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: React application (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
- `backend/`: Node.js server application

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs both the frontend and backend concurrently using [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently).
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: Typically runs on port 5000 or as configured

### `npm run start:frontend`

Runs only the React frontend in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run start:backend`

Runs only the Node.js backend server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode for the frontend.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the React app for production to the `frontend/build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for frontend deployment options.

For full-stack deployment, you may need additional configuration for your specific hosting environment.
